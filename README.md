## **Motivation**

I have lived in appartments with shared pantries and refridgerators for my entire adult life. As a consequence, I have wasted a truly upsetting amount of money on food which was (unintentionally i'm sure) misplaced or forgotten. Hence, I wanted to make a simple site where I could keep track of all my food, and warn me when something is about to go bad so that I can eat it before it does.

> Clearly my first attempt at a Figma Design XD

## **Features**

1. A Dashboard where the user can see all of their foods organized by their expiry category, along with a graphic depicting the state of their pantry
2. A pantry page where the user can enter items, and sort them during the recipe planning stage of their week.
3. An API-Powered recipe search page, where the user can search for recipe keywords, and get recommendations of things to make with their about-to-expire foods.

## **Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- A Public API called Edamam (https://www.edamam.com/)

## **Future Goals Roadmap**

In addition, should I have the time to do so, i'd like to add the following functions in the future:

- A page within the application that can provide purchasing recommendations to the user based on how often some items have expired
- A tracker that informs the user how much $$$ that they have thrown out due to spoilage
