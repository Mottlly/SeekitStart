### The goal of this project will be to build a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based pantry tracker, in order to assist the user in identifying *about-to-spoil* items and guide their weekly food consumption. See below for an ultra simple outline of the intended result:

## **Goal Defined**

Anyway, the desired functions of the application will be:

1. A super-simple browser stored database into which the user can input the foodstuffs they currently have in their pantry, with anticipated expiry dates
2. A Panel *see purple panel above* that displays items that will be expiring within a given timeframe chosen by the user
3. A Panel *see yellow panel above* that will display all foodstuffs in order of expiry
4. A simple graphic that outlines the proportion of the pantry that is non-perishable, far from expiry, close to expiry, and expired.

## **Future Goals**

In addition, should I have the time to do so, i'd like to add the following functions in the future:

1. A page within the application that can provide purchasing recommendations to the user based on how often some items have expired
2. A tracker that informs the user how much $$$ that they have thrown out due to spoilage
