    <div id="tommy_story">
        <p> This is Thomas' first project in the world of software development. This soldier, turned data analyst, turned recruiter, turned software developer, has had one defining aspect of his life for the last decade, living with his best friends.
            While he wouldn't have it any other way, the fridge always got too crowded, and food was inevitably wasted; so much so that when tasked to develop a coding project, his mind immediately jumped to saving his pantry. </p>

        <p> As Thomas' skills grow, so too will this project, and he hopes that it will help you as much as it is helping him. </p>
